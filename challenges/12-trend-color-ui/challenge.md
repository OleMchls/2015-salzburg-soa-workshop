# Challenge 12 - Trend Color UI

Now it's your task to write a web layer, which displays the data from the API. In order to separate the application logic from the display logic.

Something like this.

But of course it's totally up to you how it looks like. Check the "Test / Compliance" section to make sure your code is complient.

# Setup

```sh
$ bundle install
```

# Development

Change the code in `spec/trend_color_ui_spec.rb` line `11` to return your Rack based application and solve the challenge.

You can use whatever rack-based framework you like. And whatever folder structure you like.

# Test / Compliance

Run

```sh
$ bundle exec rspec spec
```

to check if your app complies with all the challenge's rules. Yay! :tada:
