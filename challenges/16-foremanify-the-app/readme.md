# Challenge 16 - Formanify a application

Pick one of the color-server applications and make it a 12 Factor complient app using `foreman`.

# Setup

```sh
$ bundle install
```

# Development

Make it happen!

# Test / Compliance

The app should have a `.env` and a `Procfile`.

When I run `foreman start` the application should boot and and be reachable via the configured `$PORT`.

Yay! :tada:
