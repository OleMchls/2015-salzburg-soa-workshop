# Challenge 01-01 - Basic UDP Server & Client

This introductory challenge makes you play around with an UDP server and client. Other than any other challenge it comes with a ready to run implementation.

As explained during the workshop, the non-blocking nature of the server is not exactly easy to grasp. So we use this challenge's implementation as a base for any non-blocking server that we use during any future challenge.

Make sure to have a look at the [spec/integration_spec.rb](spec/integration_spec.rb) spec to see how the testing is done and then run the tests in your vagrant box.

# Setup

```sh
$ bundle install
```

# Test / Compliance

Run

```sh
$ bundle exec rspec
```
